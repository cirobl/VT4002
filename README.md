Python program to control Votsch VT 4002 Thermal Chamber over a serial port.

More details about the VT 4002 EMC is available here:

The software supplied along with the Thermal Chamber works only in Windows.
This was an attempt to create a GNU/Linux solution and Python was the most 
logical choice to achieve it.

Please refer the spec (VT4002_climate_chamber.pdf) if you want to know 
more about it.
